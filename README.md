### Machine Learning (DS-GA 1003)

The class teaches statistical and computational methods in machine learning with a focus on supervised learning (regression and classification) and unsupervised learning (dimension reduction and clustering). Students will gain experience implementing models to solve problems with data. Topics include ridge/lass regression, support vector machines, kernel methods, conditional probability models, tree methods, gradient boosting, neural networks and mixture models.
